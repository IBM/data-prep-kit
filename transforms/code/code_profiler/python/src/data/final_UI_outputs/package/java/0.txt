To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_declaration' nodes with ids = [1], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).
This python script can be executed:

```py
#I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I just the string after the first 'import' as the package, but I also remove spaces and ';' characters from the end.
temp = code_snippet.split('import', 1)[1].strip(' ;')
# If there is an asterisk import, we remove that and return the final answer
if ('.*' in temp):
    # get the parts before the asterisk
    temp = temp.replace('.*', '')
# return the final value
extracted = temp
```
