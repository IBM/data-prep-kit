To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_statement' nodes with ids = [1, 18], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every code snippet starts with 'import', we will remove it and get the remaining string.
text = code_snippet.split('import')[1].strip() 
# get the text before the keyword 'from'
text = text.split('from')[1].strip()
# remove quotes and semicolons
text = text.replace('"', '').replace('\'', '').strip(' ;')
# return the package
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package names from the import statements, removing any quotes, semicolons, and aliases.
