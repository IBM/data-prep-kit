To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'preproc_import' nodes with ids = [1, 4], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I consider the string after the first '#import'.
test = code_snippet.split('#import', 1)[1].strip()
# Remove angle brackets or quotes
if test.startswith('<') and test.endswith('>'):
    extracted = test[1:-1]
else:
    extracted = test[1:-1]
```

This script will extract the package names from the given code snippet and AST. It removes the '#import' keyword, and then removes any angle brackets or quotes from the package name.
