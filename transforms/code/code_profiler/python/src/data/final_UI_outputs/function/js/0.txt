To find the function definition related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'function_declaration' nodes with ids = [1], represent definition of functions in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the definitions.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# we see that the function name is directly before the argument list, hence we get the snippet just before the first bracket of the argument list.
temp_0 = code_snippet.split('(')[0].strip() 
# as our required function name, from the snippet is the last one in this string, we split and get the last snippet, which is our function.
extracted = temp_0.split(' ')[-1].strip()
```

This script will extract the function name from the given code snippet. It works by splitting the code snippet at the first '(' character, taking the part before the '(' character, and then splitting that part by spaces and taking the last part, which is the function name.
