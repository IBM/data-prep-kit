To find the function definition related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'proc_declaration' nodes with ids = [1], represent definition of functions in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the definitions.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# we see that the function name is directly after the keyword 'proc', hence we get the snippet just after 'proc' and before the first '('.
temp_0 = code_snippet.split('proc')[1].split('(')[0].strip() 
# as our required function name, from the snippet is the whole string, we get the function.
extracted = temp_0
```

This script will extract the function name 'map' from the given code snippet.
