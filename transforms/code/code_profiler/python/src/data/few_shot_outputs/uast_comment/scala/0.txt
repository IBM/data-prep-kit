To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'block_comment' nodes with ids = [1], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# As the snippets start with '/*' and end with '*/', we can remove two characters from the start and two characters from the end to get the required snippet
extracted = code_snippet[2:-2].strip()
```

This script will extract the comment from the given code snippet, which is "hi".
