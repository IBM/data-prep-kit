To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'comment' nodes with ids = [1], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# As the snippets start with '#', we can remove one character from the start to get the required snippet
extracted = code_snippet[1:].strip()
```

This script will extract the comment from the given code snippet, which is "this is comment".
