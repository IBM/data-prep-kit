To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'use_declaration' nodes with ids = [1, 11], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every node has the keyword 'use', we take the snippet after the keyword
text = code_snippet.split('use', 1)[1].strip()
# remove empty side spaces.
text = text.strip(' ;')
# if it is an aliased import, get rid of the alias and keep the original name.
if (' as ' in text):
    # removing the alias
    text = text.split(' as ')[0].strip()
# return the required package import
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package names from the 'use_declaration' nodes, handling both aliased and non-aliased imports.
