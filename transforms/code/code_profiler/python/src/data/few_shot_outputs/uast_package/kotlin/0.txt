To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_header' nodes with ids = [2, 7, 13], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every code snippet starts with 'import', we will remove it and get the remaining string.
text = code_snippet.split('import')[1].strip() 
# If there is an asterisk import, we remove that and return the final answer
if ('.*' in text):
    # get the parts before the asterisk
    text = text.replace('.*', '')
# if it is an aliased import, get rid of the alias and keep the original name.
if (' as ' in text):
    # removing the alias
    text = text.split(' as ')[0].strip()
# return the final value
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package name from each import statement, removing any aliases or wildcards, and return the final package name.
