To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'use_no_statement' nodes with ids = [1, 6, 13, 23, 33, 41], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every node has the keyword 'use' and the package is present after that, we take the snippet after the keyword
text = code_snippet.split('use', 1)[1].strip()
# if the snippet has an alias, we remove it
if (' as ' in text):
    text = text.split(' as ')[0].strip()
# if the snippet has a qw or ':all' keyword, we remove it
if (' qw ' in text or ':all' in text):
    text = text.split(' qw ')[0].strip()
    text = text.split(':all')[0].strip()
# remove the keyword 'lib' if it exists
if (text.split()[0] == 'lib') :
    text = text.split('lib',1)[1].strip()
# remove semicolons and quotes
text = text.strip(' ;\'')
# return the package
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package names from the given code snippet and AST. It handles cases with aliases, qw keywords, and ':all' keywords, and removes semicolons and quotes from the extracted package names.
