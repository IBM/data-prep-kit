To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_or_export' nodes with ids = [1, 13, 23, 36, 49], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every code snippet starts with 'import', we will remove it and get the remaining string.
text = code_snippet.split('import')[1].strip()
# remove the show/hide/as keywords if present
if (' show ' in text or ' hide ' in text or ' as ' in text):
    text = text.split(' ')[0].strip()
# remove the single quotes
text = text.replace('\'', '')
# return the package
extracted = text.split(':')[1].strip()
```
