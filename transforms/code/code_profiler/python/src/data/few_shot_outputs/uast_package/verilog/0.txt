To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'include_compiler_directive' nodes with ids = [1], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
#I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I just the string after the first '`include' as the package, but I also remove spaces and '"' characters from the end.
temp = code_snippet.split('`include', 1)[1].strip(' ";')
# return the final value
extracted = temp
```

This script will extract the package 'a.v' from the given AST and code snippet.
