# Programming Language Select 

Please see the set of
[transform project conventions](../../README.md)
for details on general project conventions, transform configuration,
testing and IDE set up.

## Summary

This is a transform which can be used while preprocessing code data. It allows the
user to specify the programming languages for which the data should be identifies as matching
a defined set of programming languages.
It adds a new annotation column which can specify boolean True/False based on whether the rows belong to the
specified programming languages. The rows which belongs to the programming languages which are
not matched are annotated as False.

It requires a text file specifying the allowed languages. It is specified by the
command line param `proglang_select_allowed_langs_file`. 
A sample file is included at `test-data/languages/allowed-code-languages.lst`.
The column specifying programming languages is to be specified by
commandline params `proglang_select_language_column`.

## Configuration and command line Options

The set of dictionary keys holding configuration for values are as follows:

* _proglang_select_allowed_langs_file_ - specifies the location of the list of supported languages
* _proglang_select_language_column_ - specifies the name of the column containing the language
* _proglang_select_output_column_ - specifies the name of the annotation column appended to the parquet. 
* _proglang_select_return_known_ - specifies whether to return supported or unsupported languages

## Running

### Launched Command Line Options 
When running the transform with the Ray launcher,
the following command line arguments are available in addition to 
[the options provided by the launcher](../../../data-processing-lib/doc/ray-launcher-options).
```
  --proglang_select_allowed_langs_file PROGLANG_MATCH_ALLOWED_LANGS_FILE
                        Path to file containing the list of languages to be matched.
  --proglang_select_language_column PROGLANG_MATCH_LANGUAGE_COLUMN
                        The column name holding the name of the programming language assigned to the document
  --proglang_select_output_column PROGLANG_MATCH_OUTPUT_COLUMN
                        The column name to add and that contains the matching information
  --proglang_select_s3_cred PROGLANG_MATCH_S3_CRED
                        AST string of options for s3 credentials. Only required for S3 data access.
                        access_key: access key help text
                        secret_key: secret key help text
                        url: optional s3 url
                        region: optional s3 region```
```


### Running the samples
To run the samples, use the following `make` targets

* `run-cli-ray-sample` - runs src/proglang_select_transform.py using command line args
* `run-local-sample` - runs src/proglang_select_local.py
* `run-local-ray-sample` - runs src/proglang_select_local_ray.py
* `run-s3-ray-sample` - runs src/proglang_select_s3_ray.py
    * Requires prior invocation of `make minio-start` to load data into local minio for S3 access.

These targets will activate the virtual environment and set up any configuration needed.
Use the `-n` option of `make` to see the detail of what is done to run the sample.

For example, 
```shell
make run-cli-ray-sample
...
```
Then 
```shell
ls output
```
To see results of the transform.
