# SP Transform 
The HOSP transform enables the profiling of a given code dataset based on higher order
syntactic and semantic concepts as specified by the user. It also generates a profiling
report in HTML based on the output table. Per the set of 
[transform project conventions](../../README.md#transform-project-conventions)
the following runtimes are available:

* [python](python/README.md) - provides the base python-based transformation 
implementation.
* [ray](ray/README.md) - enables the running of the base python transformation
in a Ray runtime
