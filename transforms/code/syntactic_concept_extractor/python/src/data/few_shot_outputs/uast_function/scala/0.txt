To find the function definition related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'function_definition' nodes with ids = [1], represent definition of functions in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the definitions.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# we find that the function definition is before the first '(' 
temp_0 = code_snippet.split('(')[0].strip()
# as the function name would be the last keyword, we split by ' ' and remove extra spaces to get the function name 
extracted = temp_0.split(' ')[-1].strip()
```

This script will extract the function name 'defAddInt' from the given code snippet.
