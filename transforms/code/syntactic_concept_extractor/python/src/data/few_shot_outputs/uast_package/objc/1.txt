To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'preproc_include' nodes with ids = [1, 5, 9], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I consider the string after the first '#include'.
test = code_snippet.split('#include', 1)[1].strip()
# In the case that there are any comments, we remove them.
test = test.split('//')[0].strip()
# Remove angle brackets or quotes
if test.startswith('<') and test.endswith('>'):
    extracted = test[1:-1]
elif test.startswith('"') and test.endswith('"'):
    extracted = test[1:-1]
else:
    extracted = test
```

This script will extract the package names from the code snippets, removing any angle brackets or quotes, and ignoring any comments.
