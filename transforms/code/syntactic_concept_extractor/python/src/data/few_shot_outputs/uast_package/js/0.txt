To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_statement' nodes with ids = [1, 18], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# I can see that the some modules are imported from the package, but as I require only the package name, I will choose the snippet after the keyword 'from'
text = code_snippet.split('from')[1].strip()
# Now I will remove any empty spaces or semicolon characters, to get the imported package.
extracted = text.strip(' ;')
```
