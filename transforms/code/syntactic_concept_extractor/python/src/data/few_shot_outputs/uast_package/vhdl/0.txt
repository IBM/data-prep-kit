To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'library_clause' nodes with ids = [3, 8], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every code snippet starts with 'library', we will remove it and get the remaining string.
text = code_snippet.split('library')[1].strip() 
# remove semicolons and other non-text characters from the end
text = text.rstrip(';')
# return the package
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package names from the 'library_clause' nodes, which are 'ieee' and 'x' in this case.
