To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'include_statement' nodes with ids = [1], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every node has the keyword 'include' and the package is present after that, we take the snippet after the keyword
temp = code_snippet.split('include', 1)[1].strip()
# remove the quotes and return the package
extracted = temp.replace('"', '').replace("'", '')
```

This script will extract the package name from the given AST node. It first splits the code snippet at the 'include' keyword, takes the second part, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then removes any quotes from the package name.
