To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_declaration' nodes with ids = [5, 12, 20, 38, 56, 74], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).
This python script can be executed:

```py
# get all the words in the snippet
temp = code_snippet.split()
# initialize an empty array to store all the names of the imported packages
ans = []
# iterate through all the tokens
for word in temp:
    # By pattern, we see that all imported packages are enclosed within '"' symbols. Hence these words are te only required words.
    if (word[0] == '"' and word[-1] == '"'):
        # remove the '"' symbol from both ends.
        temp = word.strip('"')
        # check if '/' symbol is present, that means we need to extract the top level node.
        if ('/' in temp):
            # split by '/' symbol to get individual layers, and choose the top level node, the first one.
            temp = temp.split('/')[0].strip()
        # add the obtained import package to the list of our final imports.
        ans.append(temp)
# join the imports together. If there exists only one import, it will only be shown as one.
extracted = ', '.join(ans)
```
