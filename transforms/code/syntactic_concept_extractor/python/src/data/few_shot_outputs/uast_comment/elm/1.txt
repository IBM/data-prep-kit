To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'block_comment' nodes with ids = [1], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# As the snippets start with '--', we can remove two characters from the start to get the required snippet
extracted = code_snippet[2:].strip()
```
