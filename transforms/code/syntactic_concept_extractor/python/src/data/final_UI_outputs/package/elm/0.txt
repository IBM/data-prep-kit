To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'import_clause' nodes with ids = [1, 5, 12, 21, 31], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# as every node has the keyword 'import' and the package is present after that, we take the snippet after the keyword
text = code_snippet.split('import', 1)[1].strip()
# if it is an aliased import, get rid of the alias and keep the original name.
if (' as ' in text):
    # removing the alias
    text = text.split(' as ')[0].strip()
# if it has an 'exposing' clause, get rid of it and keep the original name.
if (' exposing ' in text):
    # removing the 'exposing' clause
    text = text.split(' exposing ')[0].strip()
# return the package
extracted = text
```

This script will extract the package name from each node, removing any aliases or 'exposing' clauses.
