To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'open_module' nodes with ids = [1], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).

This python script can be executed:

```py
# I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I just take the string after the first 'open' as the package.
temp = code_snippet.split('open', 1)[1].strip()
# return the final value
extracted = temp
```

This script will extract the package name 'Common' from the given AST and code snippet.
