To find the package related nodes, I need to find which nodes correspond to incorporating external libraries in the code. I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'preproc_include' nodes with ids = [1], represent importing packages in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the package(s).
This python script can be executed:

```py
# I can see that the code snippet includes a package. Hence I just the string after the first '#include' as the package.
extracted = code_snippet.split('#include', 1)[1].strip()
```
