To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'comment' nodes with ids = [1, 2], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# As the snippets start and end with '(**' and '*)', we can remove four characters from both ends to get the required snippet
extracted = code_snippet[3:-2].strip()
```

This script will extract the comment from the given code snippet, which are "A description of [t]" and an empty string for the second comment.
