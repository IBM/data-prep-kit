To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'comment' nodes with ids = [1], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.
This python script can be executed:

```py
# the first character is '#'. Hence, we can simply remove the first character and get the remaining string
extracted = code_snippet[1:].strip()
```
