To find the comment related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'line_comment' nodes with ids = [1], represent comments in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the comments.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# the first two characters are '//'. Hence, we can simply remove the first two characters and get the remaining string
extracted = code_snippet[2:].strip()
```

This script will extract the comment from the given code snippet.
