To find the function definition related nodes, I will look at the higher level nodes. Hence, I can see that the 'function_declaration' nodes with ids = [2], represent definition of functions in the code. Incorporating each of these nodes, I can make a general rule to extract the definitions.

This python script can be executed:

```py
# we see that the function name is directly after the return type, hence we get the snippet just after the first space of the return type.
temp_0 = code_snippet.split(' ')[1].strip() 
# as our required function name, from the snippet is the whole string, we get the function.
extracted = temp_0.split('(')[0].strip()
```

This script will extract the function name 'foo' from the given code snippet.
