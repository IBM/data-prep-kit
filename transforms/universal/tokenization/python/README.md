# Data Tokenization
Please see the set of
[transform project conventions](../../../README.md)
for details on general project conventions, transform configuration,
testing and IDE set up.

## Summary 
The data tokenization transform operates by converting a (non-empty) input table into an output table 
using a pre-trained tokenizer. The input table is required to have a minimum of two columns, 
named `document_id` and `contents` by default. However, alternate column names can be specified using 
`--tkn_doc_id_column` for the document id and `--tkn_doc_content_column` for the document contents.
It is essential for the values within the `document_id` column to be unique across the dataset, 
while the `contents` column stores their respective document content. To execute example demonstrations within this directory, 
a machine with `64GiB` of RAM is recommended.

To specify a pre-trained tokenizer, utilize the `--tkn_tokenizer` parameter. 
This parameter accepts the name of a tokenizer ready for download from Hugging Face, 
such as `hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer, bigcode/starcoder`, or any other tokenizer compatible 
with the Hugging Face AutoTokenizer library. Additionally, you can employ the `--tkn_tokenizer_args` parameter 
to include extra arguments specific to the chosen tokenizer. 
For instance, when loading a Hugging Face tokenizer like `bigcode/starcoder`, which necessitate an access token, 
you can specify `use_auth_token=<your token>` in `--tkn_tokenizer`. 

The tokenization transformer utilizes the specified tokenizer to tokenize each row, 
assuming each row represents a document, in the input table and save it to a corresponding row in the output table. 
The output table generally consists of four columns: `tokens, document_id, document_length`, and `token_count`.

The `tokens` stores the sequence of token IDs generated by the tokenizer during the document tokenization process. 
The `document_id` (or the designated name specified in `--tkn_doc_id_column`) contains the document ID, 
while `document_length` and `token_count` respectively record the length of the document and the total count of generated tokens.
During tokenization, the tokenizer will disregard empty documents (rows) in the input table, 
as well as documents that yield no tokens or encounter failure during tokenization. 
The count of such documents will be stored in the `num_empty_rows` field of the `metadata` file.


In certain cases, the tokenization process of some tokenizers may be sluggish, 
particularly when handling lengthy documents containing millions of characters. 
To address this, you can employ the `--tkn_chunk_size` parameter to define the length of chunks to tokenize at a given time.
For English text (`en`), it is recommended to set the chunk size to `20,000`, roughly equivalent to `15` pages of text. 
The tokenizer will then tokenize each chunk separately and combine their resulting token IDs.
By default, the value of `--tkn_chunk_size` is `0`, indicating that each document is tokenized as a whole, regardless of its length.



## Running

### CLI Options
The following command line arguments are available in addition to 
the options provided by the [python launcher](../../../../data-processing-lib/doc/python-launcher-options.md)
and the [python launcher](../../../../data-processing-lib/doc/python-launcher-options.md).
```
  --tkn_tokenizer TKN_TOKENIZER
                        Tokenizer used for tokenization. It also can be a path to a pre-trained tokenizer. By defaut, `hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer` from HuggingFace is used
  --tkn_tokenizer_args TKN_TOKENIZER_ARGS
                        Arguments for tokenizer. For example, `cache_dir=/tmp/hf,use_auth_token=Your_HF_authentication_token` could be arguments for tokenizer `bigcode/starcoder` from HuggingFace
  --tkn_doc_id_column TKN_DOC_ID_COLUMN
                        Column contains document id which values should be unique across dataset
  --tkn_doc_content_column TKN_DOC_CONTENT_COLUMN
                        Column contains document content
  --tkn_text_lang TKN_TEXT_LANG
                        Specify language used in the text content for better text splitting if needed
  --tkn_chunk_size TKN_CHUNK_SIZE
                        Specify >0 value to tokenize each row/doc in chunks of characters (rounded in words)
```

### Running the samples
To run the samples, use the following `make` targets

* `run-cli-sample` - runs src/tokenization_transform_python.py using command line args
* `run-local-sample` - runs src/tokenization_local_python.py

These targets will activate the virtual environment and set up any configuration needed.
Use the `-n` option of `make` to see the detail of what is done to run the sample.

For example, 
```shell
make run-cli-sample
...
```
Then 
```shell
ls output
```
To see results of the transform.


### Transforming data using the transform image

To use the transform image to transform your data, please refer to the 
[running images quickstart](../../../../doc/quick-start/run-transform-image.md),
substituting the name of this transform image and runtime as appropriate.
