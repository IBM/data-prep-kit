# Transforms Pacakges for both Python and Ray

Most available Transforms can be published to pypi as a single package. A detailed list of available Python transforms is available at this [link](python/README.md). Similarly the following [link](ray/README.md) provide a derailed list and installation instructions for Ray transforms



## Clone folder and update version number
````
git clone https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit.git package-release
cd package-release
````
in `.make.versions`, Set the values for DPK_MAJOR_VERSION, DPK_MINOR_VERSION and DPK_MICRO_VERSION to specify the DPK library to use and as appropriate, set the value for `DPK_TRANSFORMS_VERSION` that will be used to tag the latest version released to pypi 

`make set-versions`

## Creating src folder

Given that the transforms do not currently have their own name spaces, the first step is to  copy all the transforms to the same src folder prior to running unit tests of the individual transforms and/or building the distribution:


````
cd transforms/packaging
make clean
make src
````

## Build and Test

This procedure will run all the UT for each individual transforms using a single package configuration:

````
cd transforms/packaging
make clean
make src
make test-src
````

## Build and Deploy

This procedure will buid two wheels: one for the python transforms and one for the ray transforms.

````
cd transforms/packaging
make clean
make src
make build-dist
````

To publish the wheels to pypi.org, run:

`make publish-dist`
