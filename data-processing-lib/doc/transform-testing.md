# Transform Testing
Once a transform has been built, testing can be enabled with the provided testing framework:

* [Standalone Transform Testing](transform-standalone-testing.md) - shows how to test a transform independent of the runtime.
* [End-to-End Testing](testing-e2e-transform.md) - shows how to test the transform running in a runtime.
* [Testing Transforms with S3](transform-s3-testing.md) -shows how to set up `minio` to test transforms with the S3 interfaces.
