# Tutorial Examples
With these basic concepts in mind, we start with a simple example and 
progress to more complex transforms. 
Before getting started  you may want to consult the 
[transform project root readme](../../transforms/README.md) documentation.

* [Simplest transform](simplest-transform-tutorial.md) - 
Here we will take a simple example to show the basics of creating a simple transform
that takes a single input Table, and produces a single Table.
* [External resources transform](transform-external-resources.md) - shows how to load additional
resources (models, configuration, etc) for a transform.
* [Advanced transform](advanced-transform-tutorial.md)
