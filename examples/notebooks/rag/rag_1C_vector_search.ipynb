As can be seen from the figure, overall accuracy improves from 25.65% to 57.12% for Granite-3BCode-Base to Granite-34B-Code-Base, showing the effectiveness of model scaling in function (tool) calling capabilities. We also compare Granite-8B-Code with CodeLlama-7B in Figure 5 and find that Granite-8B-Code-Instruct beats CodeLlama-7B-Instruct by 22%, 14% and 12% on AST Summary, Execution Summary and Overall accuracy respectively. Additionally, Figure 5 shows that instruction tuning consistently improves performance of both base models, with more noticeable improvements in Granite Code models. E.g., +17.88% in overall accuracy from Granite-8B-Code-Base to Granite-8B-Code-Instruct, indicating the effectiveness of our well-curated data mixture in finetuning base models.\n",

We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",
