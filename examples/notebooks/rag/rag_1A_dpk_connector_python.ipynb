The Data-Prep-Connector is a scalable and compliant web crawler that can be used to acquire targeted content for use cases such as RAG or LLM development. In this notebook example, we will run it to selectively crawl pages under a specific path (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017) and only save the PDFs. The crawler will automatically follow robots.txt and auto-throttle based on the server response time.\n",
