The project provides instructions and deployment automation to run all components in an all-inclusive fashion on a 
single machine using a [Kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and a local data storage ([MinIO](https://min.io/)).
However, this topology is not suitable for processing medium and large datasets, and deployment should be carried out 
on a real Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Therefore, we recommend using Kind cluster for only for local testing and 
debugging, not production loads. For production loads use a real Kubernetes cluster.

Running a Kind Kubernetes cluster with Kubeflow pipelines (KFP) and MinIO requires significant
memory. We recommend deploying it on machines with at least 32 GB of RAM and 8-9 CPU cores. RHEL OS requires 
more resources, e.g. 64 GB RAM and 32 CPU cores.

## A Kind deployment supported Platforms <a name = "kind_platforms"></a> 
Executing KFP, MinIO, and Ray on a single Kind cluster pushes the system to its load limits. Therefore, although we are 
working on extending support for additional platforms, not all platforms/configurations are currently supported.

## Preinstalled software components <a name = "preinstalled"></a> 

Depending on whether a Kind cluster or an existing Kubernetes cluster is used, different software packages need to be preinstalled.

### Kind deployment <a name = "kind"></a> 
The following programs should be manually installed:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.10.0 or greater must be installed and configured on your machine.
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) tool for running local Kubernetes clusters 0.14.0 or newer must be installed on your machine.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) 1.26 or newer must be installed on your machine.
- [MinIO Client (mc)](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html) must be installed on your machine. Please 
choose your OS system, and process according to "(Optional) Install the MinIO Client". You have to install the `mc` client only.
- [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads), we use git client to clone installation repository
- [lsof](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/linux-lsof/) usually it is part of Linux or MacOS distribution.
- Container agent such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)

### Existing Kubernetes cluster <a name = "existing_cluster"></a> 
Deployment on an existing cluster requires less pre-installed software
Only the following programs should be manually installed:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.10.0 or greater must be installed and configured on your machine.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) 1.26 or newer must be installed on your machine, and be 
able to connect to the external cluster.
- Deployment of the test data requires [MinIO Client (mc)](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html) Please 
choose your OS system, and process according to "(Optional) Install the MinIO Client". Only the `mc` client should be installed.

## Installation steps <a name = "installation"></a>

Before installation, you have to deside which KFP version do you want to use. 
In order to use KFP v2, please set the following environment variable:

```shell
export KFPv2=1
```

Now, you can create a Kind cluster with all required software installed using the following command: 

```shell
 make setup
```
from this main package directory or from the `kind` directory.
If you do not want to upload the testing data into the locally deployed Minio, and reduce memory footprint, please set:
```bash
export POPULATE_TEST_DATA=0
```
You can access the KFP dashboard at http://localhost:8080/ and the MinIO dashboard at http://localhost:8090/

### Installation on an existing Kubernetes cluster <a name = "installation_existing"></a>
Alternatively you can deploy pipeline to the existing Kubernetes cluster. If your local kubectl is configured to 

In order to execute data transformers on the remote Kubernetes cluster, the following packages should be installed on the cluster:

- [KubeFlow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v1/introduction/) (KFP). Currently, we use 
upstream Argo-based KFP v1.
- [KubeRay](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html) controller and 
[KubeRay API Server](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/components/apiserver/) 

You can install the software from their repositories, or you can use our installation scripts.

If your local kubectl is configured to connect to the external cluster do the following:
```bash
export EXTERNAL_CLUSTER=1
make setup
```

- In addition, you should configure external access to the KFP UI (`svc/ml-pipeline-ui` in the `kubeflow` ns) and the Ray 
Server API (`svc/kuberay-apiserver-service` in the `kuberay` ns). Depends on your cluster and its deployment it can be 
LoadBalancer services, Ingresses or Routes. 

- Optionally, you can upload the test data into the [MinIO](https://min.io/) Object Store, deployed as part of KFP. In 
order to do this, please provide external access to the Minio (`svc/minio-service` in the `kubeflow` ns) and execute the 
following commands: 
```shell
export MINIO_SERVER=<Minio external URL>
kubectl apply -f kind/hack/s3_secret.yaml
kind/hack/populate_minio.sh
```

## Clean up the cluster <a name = "cleanup"></a>
If you use an external Kubernetes cluster set the `EXTERNAL_CLUSTER` environment variable.

```shell
export EXTERNAL_CLUSTER=1
```
Now, you can cleanup the external or Kind Kubernetes clusters by running the following command:

```shell
make clean
```

**Note** that this command has to run from the project kind subdirectory, from the root directory, the command will be
```shell
make -C kind clean
```
