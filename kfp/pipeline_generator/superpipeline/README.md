## Steps to generate a new pipeline
- create a `super_pipeline_definitions.yaml` file for the required task (similar to the example [super_pipeline_definitions.yaml](./super_pipeline_definitions.yaml)).
- execute `./run.sh <pipeline_definitions_file_path> <destination directory>`. When `pipeline_definitions_file_path` is the path of the `super_pipeline_definitions.yaml` file that defines the pipeline and `destination directory` is a directory where new super pipeline file will be generated.
