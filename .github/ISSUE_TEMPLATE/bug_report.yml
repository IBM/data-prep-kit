              Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to
              reproduce the issue. The snippet should have **no external library dependencies**
              (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments). If this is a problem within the repo (e.g., makefile)
              include the location in the repo (i.e., cd ...).
