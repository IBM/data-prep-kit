# Quick Start for Data Prep Kit 
Here we provided short examples of various uses of the Data Prep Kit.

## Running transforms 

* Notebooks
    * [Example data processing pipelines](../../examples/notebooks/README.md) - Use these to quickly process your data. A notebook structure allows a user to select/de-select transforms and change the order of processing as desired. 
* Command line  
    * [Using a docker image](run-transform-image.md) - runs a transform in a docker transform image 
    * [Using a virtual environment](run-transform-venv.md) - runs a transform on the local host 
    
## Creating transforms

* [Outside of the repository](new-transform-outside.md) - shows how to use pypi dependencies to create a transform independent of this repository.
* [Adding to this repository](new-transform-inside.md) - shows how to add a transform to this repository, including repository conventions and ci/cd.
